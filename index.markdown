*“Our state government possesses vast treasure troves of valuable information and reports: from health, business and public safety data to information on parks, recreation, labor, and transportation … The Open New York web portal will allow researchers, citizens, business and the media direct access to high-value data, which will be continually added to and expanded, so these groups can use the data to innovate for the benefit of all New Yorkers.” – Governor Cuomo, State of the State Address,        January 9, 2013*


I. INTRODUCTION
=========
###Open Data – data.ny.gov

<br/>

##Quality by Design
*	New York State is committed to proactively releasing publishable state data.
*	New York State is committed to making publishable state data openly and freely available in accessible formats for the public to reuse and consume. 
*	New York State is committed to publishing high quality data with comprehensive metadata and documentation to foster interoperability and maximize citizen understanding of the data.
*	New York State is committed to ongoing and continuous publication of publishable state data.

Government is the public’s business and the public should have access to the records of government.  New technologies have dramatically changed both the way government conducts business and the public's expectations about access to government information.  As part of this transformation, New York State launched Open.ny.gov, on March 11, 2013, dedicated to increasing public access to one of the State’s most valuable assets – data.  Its goals are to spark innovation, promote research and economic opportunities, engage public participation in government, increase transparency, and inform decision-making.  

Concurrent with the launch of Open NY, Governor Andrew Cuomo issued Executive Order No. 95, "Using Technology to Promote Transparency, Improve Government Performance and Enhance Citizen Engagement."  This unprecedented Executive Order directed covered state entities, for the first time, to identify and catalogue their data, and make publishable state data available on the new transparency website.

The concept of “Open Data” describes data that is freely available, machine readable, and formatted according to uniform technical standards to facilitate visibility and re-use of published data.  New York's open data platform is a quality by design web-based public data portal that catalogues data and enables data to be discoverable.  The portal offers access to standardized data that can be easily retrieved, downloaded, sorted, searched, analyzed, and re-used by citizens, business, researchers, journalists, developers, and government to process, trend, and innovate utilizing a singular dataset or combinations of datasets.  

OpenNY puts tools for transparency, accountability, and innovation directly into the hands of New Yorkers and people all around the world through a centralized, user-friendly interface.  This increased visibility provides derivative value as the public is able to analyze and utilize government data, and better understand what is happening in government on all levels – federal, state, and local.  

##The Open Data Handbook
This Open Data Handbook is intended as a general guide for government entities participating in data.ny.gov , as well as the general public.  The Handbook provides guidelines for identifying, reviewing, and prioritizing publishable state data for publication – with a foundational emphasis on high quality, and metadata and documentation requirements. These guidelines are intended for use by both covered state entities and other government entities not covered by Executive Order 95 (including localities).  These guidelines are also intended for use by the public in order to understand how New York State makes its publishable data sets available. 

The breadth of data and agency participation are continually being enhanced and expanded on data.ny.gov, making it a dynamic, living platform. This Handbook, providing guidelines for publication of publishable State data onto data.ny.gov, is the first step in a major shift in the way New York State government agencies share information to promote efficiency, accessibility and transparency; a major shift in the way New York State government engages citizens and fosters innovation and discovery in the scientific and business communities.  It begins the process of standardizing the state’s data, which will make it easier for both government workers and the public to discover and use the data.  This, in turn, advances “interoperability” so the data can be more easily shared and analyzed.  

Working in collaboration with state agencies, this Handbook will be supplemented, as needed, with technical and working documents addressing specific formatting, data preparation, and data refresh and data submission requirements.  We welcome input from academics, researchers, developers, businesses, entrepreneurs, and the general public to help identify data that would be useful to them and the best ways of providing it. 

##Timeline
In advancing a transparency agenda, New York State is committed to continuous publication of publishable State data.  Data discovery is an iterative and on-going process.  The following is a high-level timeline for the implementation of Executive Order 95.

1.	are in alphanumeric form reflected in a list, table, graph, chart or other non-narrative form, that can be digitally transmitted or processed;
2.	are regularly created or maintained by or on behalf of a covered State entity and are controlled by such entity; and 
3.	record a measurement, transaction or determination related to the mission of the covered State entity.
